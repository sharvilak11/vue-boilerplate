# vue boilerplate for multi module projects

> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, commit verification & scss loader.

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

It is recommended to install the global bridge to make vue cli 3 use the starter packs
``` bash
$ npm install -g @vue/cli-init
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init e9-devops/vue-boilerplate .
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.

You can alternatively add a .env file and add your desired port with PORT variable

```vue
PORT=5757
```
